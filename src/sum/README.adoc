= Sum
:toc: auto

== Description
Sum is an example of a single function embedded within Go comments. It really isn't that complex. 

I could've made it a bit more complex, such as including a header, but that's what sum-go is for.

== How to run it?
[source,shell]
----
cd src/sum
go build
----

NOTE: For this specific example, you could do `go build main.go` as well, but in later examples you can't do that because you have to also link headers and `go build main.go` is concerned only with the actual Go file, while `go build` builds the entire project.
